# Data-Science-in-Practice-Project
This is a project I did in university for the module 'Data Science in Practice' in 2018. The project, mainly carried out in Jupyter Notebooks, centers around tennis and the ATP.
Notebooks to be viewed beginning with Prep_100 followed by Analysis_100 then Results_100. After notebooks numbered 100, then move to 200 and so on. There seems to be issue with loading the notebook on GitHub so to display the notebook go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and copy and paste the link of the notebook.
